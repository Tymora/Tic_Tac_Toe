<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Our game is almost ready! Now let's combine what weâ€™ve learned in the previous stages to make a game of tic-tac-toe that two players can play from the beginning (with an empty grid) through to the end (until there is a draw, or one of the players wins).</p>
<p>The first player has to play as X and their opponent plays as O.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, you should write a program that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prints an empty grid at the beginning of the game.</li>
<li>Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell coordinates, analyzes the move for correctness and shows a grid with the changes if everything is okay.</li>
<li>Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to output the final result at the end of the game. Good luck!</p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
