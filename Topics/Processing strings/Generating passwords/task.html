<h2>Generating passwords</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The password is hard to crack if it contains at least A uppercase letters, at least B lowercase letters, at least C digits, and includes exactly N symbols. Also, a password cannot contain two or more same characters coming one after another. For a given numbers A, B, C, N you should output a password that matches these requirements.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed A, B, C, and N are non-negative integers and A + B + C &lt;= N. Keep in mind, that any parameter can be equal to zero. It means that it's ok if the password doesn't contain symbols of such type.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">3 4 1 8</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">PaSsw0rD</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
