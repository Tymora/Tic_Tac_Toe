<h2>Help the Lord Commander</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The Lord Commander of the Nightâ€™s Watch wants to know if anyone is patrolling beyond the Wall. He has two checklists from the guards: <code class="java">beyondTheWall</code> lists all who went beyond the Wall, and <code class="java">backToTheWall</code> contains the names of all those who returned. Both checklists are already initialized as lists.</p>
<p>Help the Lord Commander to check whether anyone is currently on patrol. If there is no one beyond the Wall, the output should be <code class="java">true</code>; otherwise, <code class="java">false</code>.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If a watchman is back, his name will be on both lists. That is, if all the scouts have returned, the lists must match.</p>
<p>The order of lists doesn't matter.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Benjen Stark, Alliser Thorne, Jeor Mormont<br>Benjen Stark, Alliser Thorne, Jeor Mormont</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">true</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
